= Using link:index.html[grooscript] with http://ratpack.io[Ratpack]

There is no special integration support for Ratpack, just with the https://github.com/chiquitinxx/grooscript-gradle-plugin[grooscript gradle plugin]
you can convert your groovy files to javascript and use in your browser. You can use this
plugin with any other framework or library, for example https://grails.org/[Grails].

The source code of this demo is available in https://github.com/chiquitinxx/ratpack-grooscript-demo[github]. A similar
application done with http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[Spring Boot] is deployed in http://ecosystem-gr8.rhcloud.com/, and
the source code also https://github.com/chiquitinxx/springboot-rest-demo[here]. This is my first application using
Ratpack, any pull request to improve it is more than welcome. I don't use any database, only a little static class
with the frameworks added.

Is a single page, to see a list of groovy libraries o frameworks. You can add new frameworks
filling at least name and url, can include link to external image for logo.

== Setup

I'm using Ratpack gradle plugin, and I have added grooscript gradle plugin in +build.gradle+:

[source,groovy]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
--
include::../../build.gradle[tags=doc,indent=0]
--
<1> The groovy file that will be converted to javascript.
<2> Folder where FrameworksPresenter.js will be saved.
<3> Classpath needed to compile groovy file.
<4> If you use any other groovy class in FrameworksPresenter.groovy, that classes will be converted too, and added to .js file.
<5> While Ratpack application is running in development, any modification done in FrameworksPresenter.groovy, will convert a new .js file.

== Ratpack server

The server does two things, serve the index page, and add the new frameworks to the database.

[source,groovy]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
--
include::../../src/ratpack/Ratpack.groovy[indent=0]
--
<1> Module to use groovy template engine.
<2> Get the html of all the frameworks in the 'database'.
<3> Render the groovy template, sending the frameworks html.
<4> Validate the framework in the server.
<5> Send the validated framework back to client.
<6> Location of static files (css, js, ...).

== Index page

For more info about groovy templates engine go http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/documentation/template-engines.html[here].
Our index page `index.gtpl`:

[source,groovy]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
--
include::../../src/ratpack/templates/index.gtpl[tags=doc,indent=0]
--
<1> New framework input fields.
<2> Button to validate the input fields and send to the server.
<3> Where validation and error messages are shown.
<4> Draw the frameworks list html from the model passed to the template.
<5> Javascript libraries needed.
<6> Javascript code to start the presenter.

Anijs is used for nice animations, jQuery is used by grooscript-tools to do jQuery stuff,
FrameworksPresenter.js is the javascript conversion of FrameworksPresenter.groovy and finally
*grooscript.js* is needed to run any javascript code converted by grooscript.

== Source code

I'm using a MVP pattern for this little application. Is groovy code that will run in the client
side, as javascript code. You can run the code in groovy and test it with any java / groovy
test framework. Now I'll show all the source code, the code itself is not important, the
important thing is that *is groovy and is running in your browser*.

The logic on my application is in `FrameworksPresenter.groovy`:

[source,groovy]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
--
include::../../src/main/groovy/frameworks/FrameworksPresenter.groovy[indent=0]
--
GQuery comes with grooscript, and is a wrap to work with jQuery.

The presenter connects with the view `FrameworksView.groovy`:

[source,groovy]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
--
include::../../src/main/groovy/frameworks/FrameworksView.groovy[indent=0]
--
We use another grooscript feature, HtmlBuilder to create html code with a DSL, and it works
in groovy and in javascript importing grooscript-tools.js. Also you can see I'm inserting
javascript code with @GsNative.

Finally the framework class with validations included, validations that are used in the
server and in the client side, without repeating code.

[source,groovy]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
--
include::../../src/main/groovy/frameworks/Framework.groovy[indent=0]
--

To play with grooscript, clone the source code and run with `> ./gradlew run`. Now you can modify the source groovy files,
each time you update that file, the .js file will be generated again, and you can reload the page `http://localhost:5050/` to see the changes.

== Beyond this demo

Take a look at http://grooscript.org/doc.html[grooscript documentation] to check what is supported by grooscript.

The grooscript gradle plugin has more features, as work with groovy templates in the browser,
or create http://requirejs.org[Require.js] modules, or notify the server file changes using websockets. You
can follow http://grooscript.org/starting_gradle.html[this] getting starting guide to understand better grooscript and the gradle plugin.
